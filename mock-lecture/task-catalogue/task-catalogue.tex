\begin{task}{hello-world}
What is the most common string that is first printed when learning a new programming language?
    
\solution

\end{task}



\begin{task}{foobar}

\end{task}



\begin{task}{figureexample}
This is how you reference a figure used in the figure folder of the task catalogue:

\centerline{\includegraphics{\fig smiley.png}}

Make sure that the $\backslash \text{fig}$ makro is properly set in the semesters \verb!header.sty!.
\end{task}



\begin{task}{nosol}
This task has no solution, as you can see by the following text that is automatically
appended if a \verb!\solution! is missing.
\end{task}



\begin{task}{boxexample}
Here is a codebox:

\lstset{language=Python}
\code{hello.py}

And here is the same code in a box without a frame:

\codenobox{hello.py}

Here is a box that is only displayed outside of solution documents: \Box(20, 20)

Here is another box that is only displayed inside an exam: \KBox(20, 20)

\solution

This box is never displayed: \Box(20, 20)

\end{task}



\begin{task}{reftask}

This task is curios, it references the counter of another task, namely that of
task~\ref{boxexample}.

\solution

This does not work if the internal task name does not exist:~\ref{abc}.

\end{task}
